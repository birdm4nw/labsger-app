## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
### Pre-requisites
- Download and install XAMPP.
- Install PHP last version on your device

### Procedure
1. Clone or download the repository

2. Unzip the project if it's needed, then move the project's directory *labsger-app* to the *XAMPP/htdocs* folder

3. Once the services are running you need to create and configure the database by doing the following
  - Go to *http://localhost/phpmyadmin* on the browser
  - Create a new database
  - Inside the database use the following [queries](docs/db-queries.txt) to set up the required tables.
