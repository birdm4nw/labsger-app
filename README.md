## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
1. Clone the repository

2. Go to the cipherty folder and install requirements by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Go to the [Mongo Atlas](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login) and create an account in case you hadn't it.

4. Go to **Database Access** option on left bar and configure a new user by assigning a username with a password.

5. Now, click on **Database** option on left bar, go to *Browse Collections* and hit on "Create Database". You will be asked for a database name and collection name.
  **E.g.**
  ```python
  Database name: cipherty
  Collection name: enc_data
  ```

6. Return to **Database** option, click on "Connect" and finally select "Drivers". Copy the URI you see there and paste it on your MONGO_URI variable (located in **.env** file):
  ```python
  MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
  MONGO_DB=YOUR_DB_NAME
  ```
- Do not forget to replace the username and password with the values configurated in step 4.

7. Finally, go to your **lib/db_operations.py** file within the **cipherty** folder and replace your current "Collection name" in line 24, the one configurated in step 5.

## Usage üîí
